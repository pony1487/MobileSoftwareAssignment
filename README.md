This app lets the user enter details of a situation in tournament poker and it will give a suggested list of hands to play that will give the player a strong chance to win the hand.  The user can also practice certain situations. The user can input details such as their position and stack size and they will be given a list of random hands. They then have to decide if it is correct to play or fold each hand. The app will also parse a website using JSoup. It does this so it can list upcoming poker tournaments and display them to the user. The user can then add a tournament to a list of tournaments they wish to play or keep updated on.
